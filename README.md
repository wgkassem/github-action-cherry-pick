# Cherry-Pick Github Action

Github Action to Cherry Pick commits from a branch (generally, master) and create a PR 
on another branch (Release branch).

Most of the projects have Release branches and master branch. Master branch is where
developers works on but we want to push the changes to the Release branches too. 


## Action

* Push to the monitored branch X
* Get the last commit SHA
* Checkout the other branch, Y
* Create a new pr branch Z on the branch Y
* Cherry Pick the commits from X into Z with strategy options
* Push the branch and create the PR on base Y 
* PR title will be prefixed with `AUTO`

#### Conditions:
* If base branch commit contains `AUTO`, it wont recreate the PR.

## Inputs

#### `pr_branch`

**Required** The branch name of on which PR should be created from the cherry-pick commit. 

#### `pr_labels`

CSV Labels to apply on the PR created. Default: `autocreated` 

#### `strategy_option`

Strategy option for default [ort](https://git-scm.com/docs/merge-strategies#Documentation/merge-strategies.txt-ort) strategy. Default `theirs`

## Example usage

In this example, all the merges to the branch `0.1.0` will create a PR on `0.1.X` branch too. 

```
name: PR for release branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 0.1.0
jobs:
  release_pull_request:
